 ## Course Description

In this course you will learn how to Analysis algorithms like Sorting, Searching,  and Graph algorithms. And how to reduce the code complexity from one Big-O  level to another level. Furthermore, you will learn different type of Data Structure for your code. Also you will learn how to find Big-O for every data structure, and how to apply  correct Data Structure to your problem in Java. By the end you will be able to write code that run faster and use low memory. You Also will learn  how to analysis problems using Dynamic programming. 

We will discus code complexity in Different algorithms like Sorting algorithms ( Bubble, Merge, Heap, and quick sort) , searching algorithms ( Binary search, linear search, and Interpolation), Graph algorithms( Binary tree, DFS, BFS, Nearest Neighbor and Shortest path, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A* Algorithm). and Data Structure like Dynamic Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, and Hash-Table
